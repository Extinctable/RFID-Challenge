# FLAGS

- `ATHACKCTF{}` \* User Pin code, which is randomized (XXXX; 0-9) *\
- `ATHACKCTF{Sp00fingUIDz}`
- `ATHACKCTF{printf('$money$');}`

## IMPORTANT
Unless it's impossible or technically difficult, flags should follow the format `ATHACKCTF{__________}` 
(as shown in the examples above). The random value within the brackets should be sufficiently long and non-trivial.
